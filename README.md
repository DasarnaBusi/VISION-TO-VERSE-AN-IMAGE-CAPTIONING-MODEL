# VISION-TO-VERSE-AN-IMAGE-CAPTIONING-MODEL
Overview:
Vision to Verse is an AI-powered image captioning model designed specifically for sports images. The project combines computer vision and natural language processing to automatically generate meaningful and contextually accurate captions for images. We created a custom dataset of sports images with corresponding captions for training. The model uses a CNN to extract visual features and an LSTM-based decoder to generate captions. This project demonstrates the integration of Deep Learning, NLP, and Computer Vision to translate visual content into descriptive text, effectively turning “vision into verse.”
